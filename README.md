# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow!
I just began coding in the last year or so, earning a Web Design certificate and starting my own website! Outside of computers, I enjoy performing & teaching music, playing pickleball, rock climbing, and spending time with loved ones and friends.
